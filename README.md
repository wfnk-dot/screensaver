# Screensaver

Hand-animated wallpapers, one seamless loop per screen, played by a macOS screensaver.

| Folder | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| `sources/` | The edited wallpaper images, one per screen shape |
| `scenes/` | Which effects each image gets, and where |
| `masks/` | Pictures of every effect's area, for checking (`_overview.jpg`) |
| `previews/` | Small preview loops for approval |
| `loops/` | The final loops, e.g. `night-city_widescreen.mp4` |
| `tools/render.py` | The renderer |

Screens: widescreen 3440 × 1440, 27" 2560 × 1440, Arzopa 1920 × 1080.

Adding another wallpaper: see [HOW-TO-ADD-A-NEW-WALLPAPER.md](HOW-TO-ADD-A-NEW-WALLPAPER.md).

## Timing

Every loop is 30 seconds and every effect runs on the same clock, so the
road light and the moon swell line up on all three screens. For Part 2: start each screen's player at
`(current time) mod 30s` so the screens stay in step with each other.

## Trying variations

Put extras in `scenes/variants/<name>.yml` and layer them on a scene with
`--variant scenes/variants/<name>.yml`.
